# Pack Ship Service Documentation

## Overview

The Pack Ship Service manages the packing and shipping operations in the warehouse. It implements sophisticated algorithms including 3D bin packing for optimal carton selection, multi-criteria scoring for packaging decisions, and integration with carrier systems for label generation and tracking.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the service
mvn spring-boot:run

# Run tests
mvn test

# Build Docker image
mvn spring-boot:build-image
```

## Key Features

- **3D Bin Packing Algorithm**: First-Fit Decreasing with 6 orientations
- **Multi-Criteria Carton Selection**: Volume, weight, cost, protection scoring
- **Dimensional Weight Optimization**: Minimize shipping costs
- **Multi-Carton Splitting**: Automatic order splitting for large shipments
- **Carrier Integration**: FedEx, UPS, USPS label generation
- **Real-time Tracking**: Shipment status updates
- **Packing Validation**: Ensure items fit before shipping

## Carton Selection Algorithm

### Scoring Criteria
1. **Volume Utilization** (40% weight)
   - Target: 75% fill rate
   - Penalize oversized cartons

2. **Dimensional Weight** (30% weight)
   - Minimize chargeable weight
   - Standard divisor: 166

3. **Material Cost** (20% weight)
   - Balance protection vs cost
   - Consider carton price

4. **Protection Level** (10% weight)
   - Match item fragility
   - Ensure adequate cushioning

### Standard Carton Sizes
- Small Box: 8"×6"×4" (20 lbs max)
- Medium Box: 12"×10"×8" (50 lbs max)
- Large Box: 18"×14"×12" (100 lbs max)
- Extra Large: 24"×18"×18" (150 lbs max)
- Envelope: 12"×9"×1" (5 lbs max)

## 3D Bin Packing

### Algorithm Details
- **Strategy**: First-Fit Decreasing (FFD)
- **Orientations**: All 6 rotations considered
- **Space Management**: Dynamic space splitting
- **Collision Detection**: Full 3D overlap checking
- **Complexity**: O(n × m × 6) where n=items, m=spaces

### Packing Process
1. Sort items by volume (largest first)
2. For each item, try all orientations
3. Find first fitting space
4. Place item and split remaining space
5. Continue until all items placed or no space

### Performance
- 10 items: ~50ms
- 20 items: ~150ms
- 50 items: ~500ms
- Success rate: 95%+ for standard orders

## Shipping Integration

### Supported Carriers
- **FedEx**: Ground, Express, Priority
- **UPS**: Ground, Next Day Air, 2-Day
- **USPS**: Priority, First Class, Parcel

### Label Generation
